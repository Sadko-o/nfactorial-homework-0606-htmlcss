## Specifications
Now that you understand some of the basics of HTML and CSS, letâ€™s take a look at how to align HTML elements. There are multiple ways to align HTML elements, but in this part, we recommend using flexboxes as they are widely used in modern web development (for example BootstrapV4 is built on top of flexboxes).

Refer to this great webpage on how to use flexboxes: CSS Flexbox Guide .

Also feel free to use online resources such as Stack Overflow, MDN, W3, and Google for reference.
